        To ensure consistency and fairness in the management of employee leave, the following regulations are being implemented. These guidelines apply to all employees, except where otherwise stated, or in case of emergency. Please note that any employee found using their leaves unfairly, unjustly, or otherwise will be given a warning. If an employee exceeds 3 warnings for any reason that brings losses to the company, there will be strict actions taken. The action could result in salary deduction, no raise, or in extreme cases, dismissal from the office.

        </h2>
        <p>
          Each employee is entitled to <strong>20 sick leave days</strong> per calendar year. Sick leave can be taken when an employee is ill or has a medical condition that requires time off. A medical certificate may be requested if leave exceeds <strong>3 consecutive days</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Keep in mind that there are <strong>20 sick leaves divided by 12 months</strong>. Unless there is a medical certificate justifying extra sick leaves, there will be deductions for the said leaves.

        <p>
